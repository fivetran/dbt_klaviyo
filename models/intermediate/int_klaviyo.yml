    description: >
      Table enriching events with an additional layer of last-touch attribution. 
      Though Klaviyo already performs attribution on events each day, this extra step is necessary, 
      as certain kinds of events/metrics never get attributed to flows or campaigns via Klaviyo's internal model. 

      By default, the package performs attribution [in line with Klaviyo](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005248128). 
      It considers email opens and clicks, and SMS opens as the events eligible to be credited with conversions. 
      This attribution-eligibility can be configured by the `klaviyo__eligible_attribution_events` variable. 
      Note that this refers to the events eligible to credit campaigns and flows with conversions, _not_ the events 
      eligible to receive attribution (all kinds of events are privy to this).

      Similar to Klaviyo, the package by default considers the conversion period/lookback window for email events to 
      be 120 hours (5 days) and 24 hours for SMS events. These can be configured through the 
      `klaviyo__email_attribution_lookback` and `klaviyo__sms_attribution_lookback` variables, respectively (in integer-hours).

      Note: this model has an incremental materialization. Custom event-columns specified by the `klaviyo__event_pass_through_columns`
      variable will appear here as well.

          ID used to batch an individual person's events into attribution-groups. Each event that comes 
          attributed to a campaign or flow begins a new session/batch, in which the following events without

        description: >
          Timestamp of when, relative to the current event, this person last interacted with a campaign or flow

        description: >

      with events (i.e. revenue) will be pivoted out into columns, as configured by the `klaviyo__count_metrics` and `klaviyo__sum_revenue_metrics`
