## What does this dbt package do?
- Produces modeled tables that leverage Klaviyo data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/klaviyo) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/klaviyo#schemainformation).

- Enables you to better understand the efficacy of your email and SMS marketing efforts. It achieves this by:
  - Performing last-touch attribution on events in order to properly credit campaigns and flows with conversions
  - Enriching the core event table with data regarding associated users, flows, and campaigns
  - Aggregating key metrics, such as associated revenue, related to each user's interactions with individual campaigns and flows (and organic actions)
  - Aggregating these metrics further, to the grain of campaigns, flows, and individual users

<!--section="klaviyo_transformation_model-->
The following table provides a detailed list of all tables materialized within this package by default.

| **Table**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [klaviyo__events](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/blob/main/models/klaviyo__events.sql)             | Each record represents a unique event in Klaviyo, enhanced with a customizable last-touch attribution model associating events with flows and campaigns. Also includes information about the user who triggered the event. Materialized incrementally by default. |
| [klaviyo__person_campaign_flow](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/blob/main/models/klaviyo__person_campaign_flow.sql)             | Each record represents a unique person-campaign or person-flow combination, enriched with sums of the numeric values (i.e. revenue) associated with each kind of conversion, and counts of the number of triggered conversion events. |
| [klaviyo__campaigns](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/blob/main/models/klaviyo__campaigns.sql)             | Each record represents a unique campaign, enriched with user interaction metrics, any revenue attributed to the campaign, and other conversions. |
| [klaviyo__flows](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/blob/main/models/klaviyo__flows.sql)             | Each record represents a unique flow, enriched with user interaction metrics, any revenue attributed to the flow, and other conversions. |
| [klaviyo__persons](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/blob/main/models/klaviyo__persons.sql)             | Each record represents a unique user, enriched with metrics around the campaigns and flows they have interacted with, any associated revenue (organic as well as attributed to flows/campaigns), and their recent activity. |

### Materialized Models
Each Quickstart transformation job run materializes 18 models if all components of this data model are enabled. This count includes all staging, intermediate, and final models materialized as `view`, `table`, or `incremental`.

## How do I use the dbt package?

### Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:

- At least one Fivetran Klaviyo connection syncing data into your destination.
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Databricks** destination.

#### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

### Step 2: Install the package
Include the following klaviyo package version in your `packages.yml` file:
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/klaviyo
    version: [">=1.0.0", "<1.1.0"]
```
### Step 3: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `klaviyo` schema. If this is not where your Klaviyo data is (for example, if your Klaviyo schema is named `klaviyo_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
  klaviyo_database: your_database_name
  klaviyo_schema: your_schema_name
```
### (Optional) Step 4: Additional configurations
<details open><summary>Expand/Collapse details</summary>

#### Unioning Multiple Klaviyo Connections
If you have multiple Klaviyo connections in Fivetran and would like to use this package on all of them simultaneously, we have provided functionality to do so. The package will union all of the data together and pass the unioned table into the transformations. You will be able to see which source it came from in the `source_relation` column of each model. To use this functionality, you will need to set either (**note that you cannot use both**) the `klaviyo_union_schemas` or `klaviyo_union_databases` variables:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml
...
config-version: 2
vars:
  klaviyo:
    klaviyo_union_schemas: ['klaviyo_usa','klaviyo_canada'] # use this if the data is in different schemas/datasets of the same database/project
    klaviyo_union_databases: ['klaviyo_usa','klaviyo_canada'] # use this if the data is in different databases/projects but uses the same schema name
```

#### Attribution Lookback Window

This package attributes events to campaigns and flows via a last-touch attribution model in line with Klaviyo's internal [attribution](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005248128). This is necessary to perform, as Klaviyo does not automatically send attribution data for certain metrics. Read more about how the package's attribution works [here](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/blob/main/models/intermediate/int_klaviyo.yml#L4) and see the source code [here](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/blob/main/models/intermediate/int_klaviyo__event_attribution.sql).

By default, the package will use a lookback window of **120 hours (5 days)** for email-events and a window of **24 hours** for SMS-events. For example, if an `'Ordered Product'` conversion is tracked on April 27th, and the customer clicked a campaign email on April 24th, their purchase order event will be attributed with the email they interacted with. If the campaign was sent and opened via SMS instead of email, the `'Ordered Product'` conversion would not be attributed to any campaign.

To change either of these lookback windows, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

> If you would like to disable the package's attribution process completely, set these variables to `0`.

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  klaviyo:
    klaviyo__email_attribution_lookback: x_number_of_hours # default = 120 hours = 5 days. MUST BE INTEGER.
    klaviyo__sms_attribution_lookback: y_number_of_hours # default = 24 hours. MUST BE INTEGER.
```

> Note that events already associated with campaigns or flows in Klaviyo will never have their source attribution data overwritten by the package modeling.

#### Attribution-Eligible Event Types

By default, this package will only credit email opens, email clicks, and SMS opens with conversions. That is, only flows and campaigns attached to these kinds of events will qualify for attribution in our package. This is aligned with Klaviyo's internal [attribution model](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005248128).

However, this package allows for the customization of which events can qualify for attribution. To expand or otherwise change this filter on attribution, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  klaviyo:
    klaviyo__eligible_attribution_events: ['types', 'of', 'events', 'to', 'attribute', 'conversions', 'to'] # this is case-SENSITIVE and should be in all lower-case!!
```

#### Filtering Conversion Metrics to Pivot Out

The Klaviyo dbt package pivots relevant conversion events out into metric columns in the `klaviyo__person_campaign_flow`, `klaviyo__campaigns`, `klaviyo__flows`, and `klaviyo__persons` models. The package will sum up revenue attributed to each person's interactions with flows and campaigns (plus organic actions), count the instances of each kind of triggered conversion, and, at the flow and campaign grain, count the number of unique people who converted. The package splits up events to pivot out into two variables, `klaviyo__count_metrics` and `klaviyo__sum_revenue_metrics`, which will record the count of events/users and their associated revenue values, respectively.

By default, the package is configured to pivot out the below metrics. To change the conversion events that are pivoted out, tailor the following configuration to your desired metrics in your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  klaviyo: # case insensitive 
    klaviyo__count_metrics: 
      - 'Active on Site'
      - 'Viewed Product'
      - 'Ordered Product'
      - 'Placed Order'
      - 'Refunded Order'
      - 'Received Email'
      - 'Clicked Email'
      - 'Opened Email'
      - 'Marked Email as Spam'
      - 'Unsubscribed'
      - 'Received SMS'
      - 'Clicked SMS'
      - 'Sent SMS'
      - 'Unsubscribed from SMS'

    klaviyo__sum_revenue_metrics:
      - 'Refunded Order'
      - 'Placed Order'
      - 'Ordered Product'
      - 'checkout started'
      - 'cancelled order'
```

#### Passthrough Columns

Additionally, the Klaviyo package includes all source columns defined in the [macros folder](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo_source/tree/main/macros) of the source package. We highly recommend including custom fields in this package as models now only bring in the standard fields for the `EVENT` and `PERSON` tables.

You can add more columns using our passthrough column variables. These variables allow for the passthrough fields to be aliased (`alias`) and casted (`transform_sql`) if desired, although it is not required. Datatype casting is configured via a SQL snippet within the `transform_sql` key. You may add the desired SQL snippet while omitting the `as field_name` part of the casting statement - this will be dealt with by the alias attribute - and your custom passthrough fields will be casted accordingly.

Use the following format for declaring the respective passthrough variables:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
  klaviyo__event_pass_through_columns: 
    - name:           "property_field_id"
      alias:          "new_name_for_this_field_id"
      transform_sql:  "cast(new_name_for_this_field as int64)"
    - name:           "this_other_field"
      transform_sql:  "cast(this_other_field as string)"
  klaviyo__person_pass_through_columns:
    - name:           "custom_crazy_field_name"
      alias:          "normal_field_name"
```

#### Changing the Build Schema

By default, this package will build the Klaviyo final models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_klaviyo`), intermediate models in (`<target_schema>` + `_int_klaviyo`), and staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_stg_klaviyo`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your modeled Klaviyo data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
    klaviyo:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # Leave +schema: blank to use the default target_schema.
      staging:
        +schema: my_new_schema_name # Leave +schema: blank to use the default target_schema.
```

> Note that if your profile does not have permissions to create schemas in your warehouse, you can set each `+schema` to blank. The package will then write all tables to your pre-existing target schema.

#### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:

> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
vars:
    klaviyo_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
