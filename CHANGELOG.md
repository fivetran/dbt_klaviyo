# dbt_klaviyo version.version

## Documentation
- Added Quickstart model counts to README. ([#45](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/45))
- Corrected references to connectors and connections in the README. ([#45](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/45))

# dbt_klaviyo v0.8.0
[PR #41](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/41) includes the following updates:

## Breaking Changes (Full refresh required after upgrading)
- Removed the `partition_by` logic from incremental models running on BigQuery. This change affects only BigQuery warehouses and resolves the `too many partitions` error that some users encountered. The partitioning was also deemed unnecessary for the mentioned models and their downstream references, offering no performance benefit. By removing it, we eliminate both the error risk and an unneeded configuration. This change applies to the following models:
  - `int_klaviyo__event_attribution`
  - `klaviyo__events`

## Under the Hood
- Added consistency and integrity validation tests for the `klaviyo__events` model.
- Cleaned up unnecessary variable configuration within the `integration_tests/dbt_project.yml` file.

# dbt_klaviyo v0.7.2
[PR #38](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/38) includes the following updates:

## Bug Fixes
- Removes `not_null` tests for `person_id` from `int_klaviyo__person_metrics` and `klaviyo__person_campaign_flow`. This is because Klaviyo can record events with deactivated profiles, resulting in null `person_id`s. Therefore models built off of tables with event-based grains may have null `person_id`s.

# dbt_klaviyo v0.7.1

## Dependency Updates
[PR #33](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/33) includes the following updates:
 - Corrected the package to reference the proper upstream `dbt_klaviyo_source` package dependency.

## Under the Hood:
[PR #34](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/34) includes the following updates:
- For Databricks compatibility, added the Catalog variable and updated the range to >=1.6.0,<2.0.0 in order to pass in integration testing.

# dbt_klaviyo v0.7.0

[PR #30](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/30) includes updates regarding the [September 2023](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/klaviyo/changelog#september2023) changes to the Klaviyo connector.

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨:
- We have removed and added respective fields following the new schema in the Klaviyo connector. In addition, we have removed the deprecated `integration` table and have instead passed the integration columns through `metric`. For more information, refer to the [source Klaviyo package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), where most of these changes took place.


# dbt_klaviyo v0.6.0
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨:
- We recommend running `dbt run --full-refresh` after upgrading to this version due to casting changes in the source package affecting incremental models.
## Bug Fixes
[PR #29](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/29) includes the following breaking changes:
- IDs in the upstream source package are now cast using `{{ dbt.type_string() }}` to prevent potential datatype conflicts. 
- Upstream `_fivetran_synced` is now cast using `{{ dbt.type_timestamp() }}` to prevent downstream datatype errors.

 ## Under the Hood:
[PR #26](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/26) includes the following updates:
- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job.
- Updated the pull request [templates](/.github).

# dbt_klaviyo v0.5.0

## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨:
[PR #23](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/23) includes the following breaking changes:
- Dispatch update for dbt-utils to dbt-core cross-db macros migration. Specifically `{{ dbt_utils.<macro> }}` have been updated to `{{ dbt.<macro> }}` for the below macros:
    - `any_value`
    - `bool_or`
    - `cast_bool_to_text`
    - `concat`
    - `date_trunc`
    - `dateadd`
    - `datediff`
    - `escape_single_quotes`
    - `except`
    - `hash`
    - `intersect`
    - `last_day`
    - `length`
    - `listagg`
    - `position`
    - `replace`
    - `right`
    - `safe_cast`
    - `split_part`
    - `string_literal`
    - `type_bigint`
    - `type_float`
    - `type_int`
    - `type_numeric`
    - `type_string`
    - `type_timestamp`
    - `array_append`
    - `array_concat`
    - `array_construct`
- For `current_timestamp` and `current_timestamp_in_utc` macros, the dispatch AND the macro names have been updated to the below, respectively:
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_backcompat`
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_in_utc_backcompat`
- `dbt_utils.surrogate_key` has also been updated to `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key`. Since the method for creating surrogate keys differ, we suggest all users do a `full-refresh` for the most accurate data. For more information, please refer to dbt-utils [release notes](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/releases) for this update.
- Dependencies on `fivetran/fivetran_utils` have been upgraded, previously `[">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]` now `[">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]`.

# dbt_klaviyo v0.4.2

## Under the Hood
- Ensures that the incremental strategy used by Postgres and Redshift adapters in the `klaviyo__events` and `int_klaviyo__event_attribution` models is `delete+insert` ([#9](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/22)). Newer versions of dbt introduced an error message if the provided incremental strategy is not `append` or `delete+insert` for these adapters.

# dbt_klaviyo v0.4.1
## Bug Fixes
- Incorporate the `try_cast` macro from [fivetran_utils](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_utils/tree/releases/v0.3.latest) to ensure that the `numeric_value` field in `klaviyo__person_campaign_flow` is the same data type as '0'. [Issue #17](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/issues/17)

# dbt_klaviyo v0.4.0
🎉 dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility 🎉
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_klaviyo_source`. Additionally, the latest `dbt_klaviyo_source` package has a dependency on the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. Further, the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.
- The updates highlighted within the Bug Fixes section are changes to the incremental logic of the `klaviyo__events` table. As such, a `dbt run --full-refresh` will be needed after installing this version of the dbt_klaviyo package as a dependency within your `packages.yml`
- Accommodating the breaking change within the dbt_klaviyo_source package for the name change of the `union_schemas/datbases` variables to be `klaviyo_union_schemas/databases`.

## Bug Fixes
- Leverage the `unique_event_id` surrogate key from the `stg_klaviyo__events` model within the incremental logic of `int_klaviyo__event_attribution` and `klaviyo__events` to better account for the uniqueness of events across different connectors.

# dbt_klaviyo v0.3.0

## Features
- Allow for multiple sources by unioning source tables across multiple Klaviyo connectors.
([#11](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/11) & [#12](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/12))
  - Refer to the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo#unioning-multiple-klaviyo-connectors) for more details.

## Bug Fixes
- Correct [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo#attribution-eligible-event-types) in pointing out that the `klaviyo__eligible_attribution_events` variable is case-SENSITIVE and must be in **all lowercase**.

## Under the Hood
- Unioning: The unioning occurs in the staging tmp models using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro. ([#8](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo_source/pull/8))
- Unique tests: Because columns that were previously used for unique tests may now have duplicate fields across multiple sources, these columns are combined with the new `source_relation` column for unique tests and tested using the `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns` macro. ([#8](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo/pull/11))
- Source Relation column: To distinguish which source each record comes from, we added a new `source_relation` column in each staging and final model and applied the `fivetran_utils.source_relation` macro. ([#8](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo_source/pull/8))
    - The `source_relation` column is included in all joins and window function partition clauses in the transform package. Note that an event from one Klaviyo source will _never_ be attributed to an event from a different Klaviyo connector.
